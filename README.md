# data
Data from a variety of sources which I cite in my online portfolio and in the README file

Datasets:

The "spambase" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Please see the following link for the documentation: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/
The .csv file in my "data" Github repository was reconstructed from the original dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.data) to include all 57 feature names and target name 'spam'.

Brief info about the variables can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.names

The "World Happiness Report" 2019 survey data csv file is posted here in the data repository. More information about the survey can be found at https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/changing-world-happiness/
